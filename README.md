# mini_dictionary
The project "Mini Dictionary" is a console application with graphics developed using the C++ programming language. I have made a user oriented and friendly application that maintains all the words and their corresponding meanings. This project is a fine thought to make the tedious task of going through a dictionary, to look up a word, simple.
